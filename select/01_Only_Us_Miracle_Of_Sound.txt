When bells of shame have faded
And I remain reviled
Let vengeance roar for blood and war
Behind a scornful smile
The vow, the kin, the rival
A vision violent, vile
These questions three have haunted me
Since I was but a child
So much I have lost and so much I resent
My spite became the steps upon the stairway of descent
Let it all burn down around us
Let the cruel consume the just
Let the sin we swim in drown us
Let the world shatter
Into dust
Nothing else matters
Only us
When kings have long been buried
When vows have long been lost
When the night brings fear then the lion's tears
Shall fall on fire and frost
This hopeless doomed devotion
The poison that I crave
I jilt the new to return to you
Endure you till my grave
I'm no man of honor, my guilt runs dark and deep
My oaths betray each other till there's nothing left to keep
Let it all burn down around us
Let the cruel consume the just
Let the sin we swim in drown us
Let the world shatter
Into dust
Nothing else matters
Only us
And they will raze our towers
And spit upon our names
And the ravens black over the fields of ash
Will whisper our tales of shame
Let it all burn down around us
Let the cruel consume the just
Let the sin we swim in drown us
Let the world shatter
Into dust
Nothing else matters
Only us
