[00:22.06] I take off time to time
[00:24.83] With those crazy friends of mine
[00:28.04] Head out on steel horses
[00:31.14] With wheels and we ride
[00:42.64] 
[00:33.82] We burn up that road to old Mexico
[00:39.18] Blend in with the desert
[00:41.98] Just we amigos
[00:44.40] And we roll
[00:49.90] 
[00:49.34] And cowboys like us sure do have fun
[00:54.90] Racing the wind, chasing the sun
[01:00.17] Take the long way around back to square one
[01:06.26] Today we're just outlaws out on the run
[01:11.47] There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
[01:17.28] For cowboys like us
[01:26.78] 
[01:24.33] We talk about living, babies and women
[01:30.00] All that we've lost and all we've been giving
[01:35.63] We sing about true love, lie about things we ain't done
[01:41.10] Drink one more cold one, come morning get up
[01:46.22] And we roll
[01:51.72] 
[01:51.34] Cowboys like us sure do have fun
[01:56.65] Racing the wind, chasing the sun
[02:02.04] Take the long way around back to square one
[02:07.92] Today we're just outlaws out on the run
[02:13.46] There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
[02:18.98] For cowboys like us
[02:28.48] 
[02:36.36] Cowboys like us sure do have fun
[02:41.80] Racing the wind, chasing the sun
[02:47.07] Take the long way around back to square one
[02:52.86] Today we're just outlaws out on the run
[02:58.38] There'll be no regrets, no worries and such
[03:04.04] For cowboys like us
[03:13.54] 
[03:15.42] Cowboys like us
